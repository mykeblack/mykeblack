### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my repository. It's been a bit of a while since I updated it last because, you know, life and work and all that stuff gets in the way. Anyway, I will be publishing code to my repo more regularly from now on.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
mykeblack.com website v5 - yes its been 7 years since I last updated it so it's long overdue a makeover!
also some games - Captain Blackstar that is nearly done, and Eskape, which I'm just doing the pre-production phase - generating hte GDD.
and if I get time, I am also planning on cleaning up my study. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
Freelance or contract work. I am a games designer and website developer - you can get my CV off my website mykeblack.com/cv. 
I can do pretty much any web tech and am working on some unity games projects on the side.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
email is best - myke.black@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: 
There are only 4 types of mammal that lays eggs- all of which live in Australia.
